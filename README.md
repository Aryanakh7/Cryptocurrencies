# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary of the Analysis 

The goal of this analysis is to create a report for an investment bank including the specific type of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they can be properly grouped to create a classification system interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. The data provided by CryptoCompare will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output we will use unsupervised learning. In order to achieve this, unsupervised learning will be performed to process data, cluster dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA on data provided by CryptoCompare.
