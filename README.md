## Summary of the Analysis 

You understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. Itâ€™s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

The goal of this analysis is to create a report including the specific type of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they can be properly grouped to create a classification system for an investment companyinterested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers.

The data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output we will use unsupervised learning.
