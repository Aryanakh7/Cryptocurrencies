# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary of the Analysis 

The goal of this analysis is to create a report including the specific type of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they can be properly grouped to create a classification system for an investment companyinterested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. In order to achieve this, unsupervised learning will be used to process data, cluster dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA. 

The data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output we will use unsupervised learning.
